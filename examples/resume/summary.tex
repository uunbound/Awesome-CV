I am a software engineer and entrepreneur based in Amsterdam. I have professional software development experience for 12+ years and have taken several leading roles in various tech companies. 

My main strength is in software development and architecture and I am very comfortable with coding in Python. Having experience in backend, frontend, and native mobile development, I consider myself a full-stack ninja who is able to set up, architect, and build modern internet products. 

Next to my hobby projects and startup, I enjoy photography and reading books on business and finance. I constantly try to push myself out of my comfort zone in attempt to discover new things about my self and my surroundings.
